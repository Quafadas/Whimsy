## Aim
High performance shim to native vector libraries. Currently shims to BLAS.

## Why?
To guarantee best in class performanc for vector operations in a cross platform context.

## Status:
Need a reliable JS shim that imports via ES Modules.

Fundamentals work.

## Future
If we ever hit a serious performance bottleneck, consider a shim to https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-accelerated-libraries

via [slinc](https://github.com/scala-interop/slinc)
