title: Mill Site

https://github.com/Quafadas/millSite

## Aim
Publish static wesites based on new scaladoc - i.e. next to the API

## Why?
I like mill, I struggled to find a good answer to this question.

## Status:
Works, but needs polish.

- Cross platform API?
- Scala JS examples?
  - via mdoc?

## Future
Would love to finish this one off.
