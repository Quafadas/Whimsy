## Aim
To learn about mirrors in scala 3. It also provides a "just enough" library to practise documenting and publishin issues.

## Why?
It was fun

## Status:
Complete. Currently no need to change any of the fundamentals.

## Bonus
Write a scalaJS facade for datatables.net


## Future
Don't see one - continue updating the publishing mechanism to improve understanding of the tooling landscape.
