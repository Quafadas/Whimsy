## Aim
High performance shim to native vector libraries. Currently shims to BLAS.

## Why?
To guarantee best in class performanc for vector operations in a cross platform context.

## Status:
Complete. Currently no need to change any of the fundamentals.

## Future
If we ever hit a serious performance bottleneck, consider a shim to https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-accelerated-libraries
