title: Viteless

TL:DR

## Simon's Guerilla guide to getting started with Scala JS.


# Goal 

   > Can we replicate the vite "experience" of web development... _without_ vite, or NPM, or node. 

Basically, toss  JS tooling in the bin :-). 

How much fun can it really be, to configure node. And NPM. And vite. And then do it all again in CI. 

Wouldn't it be more fun to... write our own frontend development server?

This is, in a way the natural evolution  to [this post][2024-03-03-ESModules-At-Link-Time copy.md]. 

## Contraints

"replicating vite" is a big job. I might be stupid, but I ain't that bloody stupid :-). We aren't trying to replicate vite, with it's big plugin ecosystem and support of whatever the latest frontend whizzbangery is these days. We're trying to replicate vites _experience_ for _my_ scalaJS projects. 

I claim that this is less stupid. YMMV.

Funnily enough though, once you break it down, each invidual piece is... not that bad...

## Features

1. insta-style application
1. proxy requests to backend
1. open webpage on start
1. resolve references to JS eco-system
1. serve website
    1. naively 
    2. reloadably-on-change

Collectively, this forms our definition of done

### 1. Insta Style Application

I style things with [LESS](https://lesscss.org/). It turns out, that this is [built right in](https://lesscss.org/usage/#using-less-in-the-browser-watch-mode). 

We will not be needing vite, to save ourselves from a script tag in our html. One down.

### 2. Proxy requests to backend

We're in scala, right? A mythical land where just about everyone you trip over is secretly a backend ninja. _Someone_ must have a prox... [well hello](https://github.com/davenverse/equilibrium). 

Mostly, I copied and pasted code from there and poked it with a sharp stick until it did what I wanted. 

### 3. open webpage on start

At least make it a challenge... 

```scala
  def openBrowserWindow(uri: java.net.URI): Unit =
    println(s"opening browser window at $uri")
    if Desktop.isDesktopSupported() && Desktop.getDesktop().isSupported(Desktop.Action.BROWSE) then
      Desktop.getDesktop().browse(uri)
```
### 4. resolve references to JS eco-system

Finally! Something non-trivial...

The big observation here, is that one can resolve ESModules _directly_ out of scala JS ES module syntax. See this post for more detail. [ES Modules at link time][2024-03-03-ESModules-At-Link-Time copy.md]. This capability is now in SBT, scala-cli and mill. 

Fior the purposes of this excercise, it _negates the need for a bundler_. Instead, we can rely on the _browser_ resolution of ES Modules. From a strategic perspective - sure we're giving up vite. But we replace it with a ** _Browser_ **. Vite is good software, sure, but there are leagues, and vite ain't in the same league as Chrome or Safari. I never looked back.

### 5. serve website
#### Naively

There is a very simple approach, which is just serve straight out of javas simple http server. 

```sh
$JAVA_HOME/bin/jwebserver -d c:/temp/helloScalaJs/out -p 8000
```

That server starts super fast, and it proves our concept to this point works, because it resolves the modules and we can visit it in browser. It's here because firstly it's an easy way to verify the steps to this point, and also, because it's super useful for unit testing. It's killer in combination with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/intro).

As part of a hot development loop however, it's seriously lacking. We need to restart the app on every change - which is not the experience we are looking for.

# Hot Reload

Well, we now come to the point. If do things the vite way, then we need to somehow track all the module dependancies, figure out which one has changed or is dependant, reload it and heaven knows what else. Vite seems to setup some heavy duty websocket comms to manage all this. 

But at this point, we're like 100 lines of blogpost in. 

![bah](/docs/assets/indiana-jones-sword-vs-gun.webp)

```scala
for ((p: Path, h: Hash) <- modules)
      yield link(rel := "modulepreload", href := s"${p}?hash=${h}")
```

Instead of all that, the proposal is to generate `index.html` on the fly. We include in the header _all_ the modules generated by the scala JS compiler as module preloads - they are all aggressively downloaded by the browser when `index.html` loads. 


They also have some nice properties. If they match the hash, then the browser hits it's cache. The browser cache is _fast_. If we change the hash, our (changed) module re-downloads. It also means that there's no "module ping pong" as it traverses the module graph - it hits the cache _every time_, because we pre-loaded _all_ the modules.

Our dev server monitors file changes, and updates a `MapRef[File, Hash]`, that we can use to generate that index.html. 

The final thing we need to do is include in `index.html` a script which refreshes the page when it recieves the right event from our dev server. 

```js
const sse = new EventSource('/api/v1/sse');
sse.addEventListener('message', (e) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(e.data)

  if ('KeepAlive' in msg)
      console.log("KeepAlive")

  if ('PageRefresh' in msg)
      location.reload()
});
```

And then send events to trigger a page refresh.

```scala
  case GET -> Root / "api" / "v1" / "sse" =>
    val keepAlive = fs2.Stream.fixedRate[IO](10.seconds).as(KeepAlive())
    Ok(
      keepAlive
        .merge(refreshTopic.subscribe(10).as(PageRefresh()))
        .map(msg => ServerSentEvent(Some(msg.asJson.noSpaces)))
    )

```

# Does it work? 

Surprisingly. Yes.
