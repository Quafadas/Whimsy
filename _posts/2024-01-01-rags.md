## Aim
Experiment with retrieval augmented generation in scala

## Why?
I've been on the "business side" of some of the proposed solutions, and they didn't fulfil the needs. In particular, the challenge of

- generating prompts
- gaining an intuition for useful promting
- ensuring future quality

Caused me quite some concern.

## Notes
I think there are three key ways we could consider differenting this project.

1. Mills fine grained caching, could allow a constant time feedback loop, even as number of documents and prompts grow.
2. If we write a X platform API, it shoudl be possible to expose diagnostic information to the user via a web api. This could be used to build a UI to help users understand the quality of their prompts.
3. Consider seperation of retrieval via cosine search, and generation.
