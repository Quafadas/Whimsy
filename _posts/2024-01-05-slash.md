## Aim
A friendly, cross platform linear algebra library for scala 3

## Why?
It's fun! And actually, one would be pretty useful at $work.

## Status:
Still on the fence about some of the compile time shenanigans needed to get Vector opertations to compose. Howeever, the library works and I'd want to continue contributing to it.
